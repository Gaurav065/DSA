---- Forming equations------


1. O(1): mathematics, no loops, no  recursion, no function call

for example: 

def(x,y):
    result=x*y
    return result

O(1)


2. O(n): loops, recursion, function calls


for example: for i in range(X):
                print(i)


3. O(n^c): nested loops or nested functions


4. O(log(n)): there is a loop, and the loop vaiable is divided or multiplied 


5. O(Log(logn)): when the loop variable is increased or decreased by exponential ammount that is in power for example I^2, 3,4,...n
